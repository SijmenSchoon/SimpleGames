# SimpleGames
A collection of simple games I started making because I have always had a hard
time actually finishing projects. I set a goal for myself to make a lot of tiny
games, and to never spend more than a week for each game.

## Pong
A pong clone. Left side is controlled with the up/down arrows, and the right
side is controlled by the computer. To compile, have SFML around and run:
```
make pong
```
I should really add a dotted line in the middle, but I can't be bothered.

## Breakout
A breakout clone. Press E to toggle between editor mode and playing mode. In
playing mode, left/A and right/D control the paddle. In editor mode, the arrow
keys or WASD control the cursor, space toggles the brick, and c toggles the
color. To compile, have SFML around and run:
```
make breakout
```
